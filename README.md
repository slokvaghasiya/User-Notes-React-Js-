#User-Notes( Reac-js, NodeJs with MongoDb )

--> I created this web-app to learn about the interaction between the front-end and back-end.
--> Users can create, update, and delete notes, which are stored in the backend.So, I implemented the login/register module to authorised individual user.
--> I used JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to verify individual users.
